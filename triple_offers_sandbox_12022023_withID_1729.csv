Family run and operated for generations, and welcoming you with a new wine bar and delectable food concept, Sergimmo Salumeria is a spot that's close to major subway stops and tourist destinations. The story of the eatery is just as joyful as the food itself. In 1970, two brothers Giovanni and Fillippo Badalamenti, moved from Sicily to New York with nothing more than an elementary education and a hunger for opportunity. The brothers started their business in Astoria, Queens, which was the heart of Italian salumerias. With their driven personalities, ambition, work ethic, and family pride, their business prospered. Giovanni kept the tradition going after Fillippo's retirement in 1993, launching the current location in Whitestone, Queens. With such dedication and talent, it's little wonder the Salumeria became the source of all the finest Italian food and products in the area. Giovanni's sons, Sergio and Massimo, took over the family business after his retirement, becoming the second generation to continue the legacy. As children, Sergio and Massimo watched and worked closely with their father as he made traditional Italian specialties such as fresh mozzarella, ricotta, scamozza, and all sorts of Italian cured meats. The brothers honor those years by keeping the traditional specialties while also introducing more modern Italian culinary touches. Sergio and Massimo are constantly updating and perfecting their art in authentic yet modern Italian foods, which is why they travel yearly to Sicily seeking the very best cheeses, cured meats, spices, oils, bread, coffee, wine, and new techniques.
