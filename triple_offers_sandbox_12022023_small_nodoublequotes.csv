The pit is an enclosed structure that cooks meats without the benefit of fiery coals directly underneath. You will find this method chides and cajoles even an ornery piece of meat into a flavorful and succulent delight.  Lone Spur uses a combination of oak and hickory to flavor their beef brisket, pork and chicken. The name of the game is to cook low and slow and try to maintain a temperature that will provide the juiciest and most tender meat - in fact, many of their meats are smoked for at least 12 hours!  In addition to their delicious barbecue, Lone Spur serves a number of southwestern dishes from their kitchen, and kids always eat free on Sundays.  Happy hour is offered seven-days-a-week along with nightly bar specials and half-price appetizers on Friday and Saturday from 9-11 p.m.  Remember, they're barbecuing Texas-style at Lone Spur!",FOOD

And you can layer on, as well. When the menu says fresh eggplant, it means it, honorably grilled (and the mushrooms, too, and peppers and so on). The good crust also carries the cheese-less guilt-free version, which could be pretty dull. But Potomac Pizza makes lactose-intolerant customers, and the increasing number of children who doctors think may be allergic, feel less like oddballs in the takeout queue. Adorned with fresh tomatoes, broccoli and mushrooms (before you add on), the pizza suggests an open-faced picnic focaccia. It's nice to be able to report that the subs and sandwiches are equally generous and can be as green or low-fat as you like. It's true!  This eatery is a total yum-fest, where they make their non-fat sauce and dough fresh daily and fry only with trans fat-free, no-cholesterol canola oil. Along with divine Pizzas and Calzones, Potomac does dreamy Salads, which you can have with regular, light or fat-free dressing.

Critic Lou Harry of the INDIANAPOLIS BUSINESS JOURNAL called the restaurant's pizza crust a heavenly base for the larger-than-personal/smaller-than-your-local-chain pies at Martha Hoover's latest eatery. He continued, With a brick-oven crispness and the strength to hold its ingredients, the crust also features a light, pillowed rim. It's equally effective containing the moist dilled crème fraiche on the Smoked Salmon variation and the more recognizable ingredients (but here, still tasting new) on the Buffalo Mozzarella version... Meanwhile, the Neapolitan Sandwiches come on house-made, stone-hearth bread.

And you can layer on, as well. When the menu says fresh eggplant, it means it, honorably grilled (and the mushrooms, too, and peppers and so on). The good crust also carries the cheese-less guilt-free version, which could be pretty dull. But Potomac Pizza makes lactose-intolerant customers, and the increasing number of children who doctors think may be allergic, feel less like oddballs in the takeout queue. Adorned with fresh tomatoes, broccoli and mushrooms (before you add on), the pizza suggests an open-faced picnic focaccia. It's nice to be able to report that the subs and sandwiches are equally generous and can be as green or low-fat as you like. It's true!  This eatery is a total yum-fest, where they make their non-fat sauce and dough fresh daily and fry only with trans fat-free, no-cholesterol canola oil. Along with divine Pizzas and Calzones, Potomac does dreamy Salads, which you can have with regular, light or fat-free dressing. And if you're going the entree route, these folks prepare Parmigianas and both Vegetable and Meat Lasagna that aren't as good as Grandma's ... THEY'RE WAY BETTER!   ",FOOD

I emerged 30 minutes later absolutely redolent with the scent of oak, pecan and meat, glorious meat. And here final assessment of the brisket? It was juicy, tender, smoky, hazily unctuous stuff -- the kind of brisket you'd truly make if you had a Saturday to yourself in the backyard. How do these guys achieve such perfection? First, the meats are smoked over an oak and pecan fire to give them a unique flavor. And, of course, these folks make their own BBQ sauces and sides from scratch, so count on being barraged with fresh, bold flavors. Better yet, you can have your choice of meats (Brisket, House Sausage, Hot Links, Pork Ribs, Chicken, Smoked Turkey) in a sandwich, atop a salad, or piled high on a BBQ plate.

It's been featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives, and Anthony Bourdain visited Woodyard with blues rockers the Black Keys for his program No Reservations. The surprising thing about Woodyard is that for decades, its main business was supplying smoke wood for Kansas City's other legendary barbecue restaurants. A few years ago, the Woodyard owners decided to get in on the barbecue action themselves, and rose to the top like, well, a column of smoke. Woodyard still sells hickory, oak, cherry, pear, apple and other woods by the bundle or cord. Woodyard has its own no-sugar rub that it uses on its meats, and it's for sale in bottles alongside their mild and hot barbecue sauces.
