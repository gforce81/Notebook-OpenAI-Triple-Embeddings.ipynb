Back then, pizza was strictly Old World Italian fare, but little did Ferdinand know that diners would go crazy for this simple and humble dish when, in 1964, the first official Rosati's was opened. By 1978, a total of 10 Rosati family members owned carry-out pizzerias, firmly establishing the Rosati family name as a leader in the pizza restaurant business. Today, there are nearly 200 Rosati's restaurants across the country, and it has even been inducted into the Pizza Hall of Fame. And, with a legacy for amazing, fresh, and oh-so tasty food, every time you enjoy a pizza or a meal from Rosati's, you're tasting the tradition that made Rosati's a neighborhood tradition.",FOOD

The idea back then was the same as it is now: make the most delicious, craveable slice of pizza on the planet. They dreamed of a world where happiness could be found in the simple things, such as a mouthwatering slice of pizza and an ice-cold beer. As Mellow Mushroom locations continue to sprout, such as this spot in Little Rock, the mission remains the same. One of this eatery's defining features is that each store is its own entity -- an original work of art that stands apart from any other Mellow you may visit. The menus, like the location itself, are as eclectic as the fans who hunger for the eatery's popular pizzas, hoagies, calzones and salads. Pairing up a perfect libation (check hour Happy Hour specials weekdays from 3-6 p.m.) with just the right pizza is a big part of the fun here, especially when you're choosing between the Maui Wowie, Funky Q Chicken, and Philosopher's Pie pizzas. Whatever you order, the quality is high, and that includes gluten-free dough and numerous vegan options. The same passion that Mellow exhibits for its food is just as present behind the bar. From the list of premium spirits and the pizza-perfect craft beers offerings to the 100-percent all-natural juices, syrups, and purees (no dyes or high fructose corn syrups here), the libations are never an after-thought.
