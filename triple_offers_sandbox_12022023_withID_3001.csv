People would line up outside throughout the summer waiting to get their hands on the new product Mike was offering: submarine sandwiches. A 17-year-old employee, Peter Cancro, bought the place in 1972, maintaining the high quality and personalized service that had made it famous. He soon opened more locations and eventually started franchising the business, building it into the nationwide enterprise it is today.  To this day, everything about Jersey Mike's is high quality. Their certified Angus beef top rounds are trimmed and cooked right in the store. The meats and cheeses are all top-quality premium brands, and the bread is baked fresh each day on the premises. Plus, everything's prepared right in front of you, exactly the way you want it. Grab one of Jersey Mike's famous hot or cold subs, like chipotle cheese steak or the Big Kahuna, or change things up with a chicken Caesar or grilled veggie wrap. You can even ditch the bread entirely and turn any sub into a salad. On top of all that, every Jersey Mike's shop makes a special effort to support its community through donations, fundraisers, sponsorships, and inspiring messages. These are traditions Jersey Mike's will never outgrow.",FOOD
